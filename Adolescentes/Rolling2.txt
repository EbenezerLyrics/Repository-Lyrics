I'm not known for being this naughty
What you wanna do with my body?
Play me like a brand-new Atari
Smoking trees, I don't need Ferrari
I've been rollin' all my life, I'm doin' on my way
I've been shakin', shakin', shakin', I've been makin' waves
I've been changin' all the game, I mean the tin will shake
The highest price you pay is the hardest part to play
Rolling
Making some green and I show it
So when you see me, you know it
Flamin' on my own emotions, -otions
New hair, new bag
New weave, stay mad
New things, who's that?
Straight up, just facts
New beef, the D
She that, just gag
New this, new that
Are you this? Are you that?
New this, new that
Are you this? Are you that?
I've been rollin' all my life, I'm doin' on my way
I've been shakin', shakin', shakin', I've been makin' waves
I've been changin' all the game, I mean the tin will shake
The highest price you pay is the hardest part to play
Rollin'
Rollin' (new hair)
Making some green and I show it (new bag)
So when you see me, you know it
Flamin' on my own emotions (new this), -otions
Straight up, just facts
New beef, the D
(She that) she that, just gag
(New this) new this, (new that) new that
Are you this? Are you?
